This directory contains two programs:
simplegrab.cpp and
simplegrab-profile.cpp

NOTE: the location of the include and lib directories for the Triclops and 
libdc1394 installation needs to be set in the Makefile for the ROOT_INCLUDE 
and ROOT_LIB values.

These programs were tested for Bumblebee and Bumblebee2 cameras against the
libdc1394-2.0.2 release.

The code requires certain general purpose helper functions that are located
in ../pgrlibdcstereo - please build this library first.

The idea behind these examples is to show in a simple a way as possible how
to acquire stereo images from a Bumblebee or Bumblebee2 camera using
libdc1394-2.

simplegrab-profile.cpp is the same as simplegrab.cpp but allows you to
measure how many frames per second you were able to grab and process.

Stereo processing is not done in this example.  For that, please consult
../simplestereo/simplestereo.cpp.

Unfortunately, the color processing chain provided by libdc1394 for Bayer
images is not very efficient for Bumblebee and Bumblebee2 cameras.  This is
because the libdc1394 code is designed for single lens cameras, which is
perfectly reasonable.
