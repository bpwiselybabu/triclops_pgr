triclops_pgr
============
This project has the point grey, Triclops SDK built using cmake. 
The version used is the 3.3 Triclops SDK from the Point grey downloads page for linux.

It is converted to cmake build system and handles dependencies with dc1394 much better and you dont have to edit
any build files to set up the path.
Also the cmake.config files are generated and installed so you can use it with cmake_find()
